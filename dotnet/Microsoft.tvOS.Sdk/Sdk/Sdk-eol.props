	Imported only by .NET projects whose .NET version we don't support anymore (currently .NET 6), contains settings to force the error:

	error NETSDK1202: The workload 'tvos' is out of support and will not receive security updates in the future. Please refer to https://aka.ms/maui-support-policy for more information about the support policy.

	Things to note:

	* $(WarningsAsErrors) includes NETSDK1202
	* Force $(TargetPlatformVersion) to just be 21.0, to make it past early error messages
	* _ClearMissingWorkloads prevents undesired extra error messages
