    <summary>Abstract base class providing local and cloud-based management of Model data.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        Application developers can subclass <see cref="UIDocument" /> to create objects that are "Model-Controllers" and
        relate to Model (domain) objects analogously to how <see cref="UIViewController" /> relate to <see cref="UIView" />s.
        UIKit provides a number of functions, including background asynchronous reading and writing of application data,
        automatic and safe data-saving, storage that is automatically coordinated between the application sandbox and cloud services, etc.
      </para>
      <para>
        At a minimum, application developers need to implement <see cref="ContentsForType(string,out NSError)" /> (for storage) and
        <see cref="LoadFromContents(NSObject,string,out NSError)" /> (for retrieval). Additionally, application developers need to
        manage the lifecyle of the <see cref="UIDocument" /> and this requires the application developer to set the preferred storage
        location, create a file URL, and discover, open, and close the file. Application developers should also track changes and resolve
        conflicts between document versions.
