# AVFoundation

## We only bind "finished" as we cannot use [Bind] here as it would break compatibility with iOS 6.x
## `isFinished` was only added in iOS 7.0 SDK and cannot be called in earlier versions
!missing-selector! AVAssetResourceLoadingRequest::isFinished not bound

## it's already defined in the base class, it's fine even if it returns mutable tracks in this case 
!missing-selector! AVMutableComposition::tracks not bound

## AVVideoCompositionInstruction is both a class and a protocol - so we have duplicate entries
## and right now only implement the type (protocol can't have the same name anyway)
!missing-selector! AVVideoCompositionInstruction::enablePostProcessing not bound
!missing-selector! AVVideoCompositionInstruction::passthroughTrackID not bound
!missing-selector! AVVideoCompositionInstruction::requiredSourceTrackIDs not bound
!missing-selector! AVVideoCompositionInstruction::timeRange not bound

## AVAudioPlayer INTERRUPTION NOTIFICATIONS ARE DEPRECATED - Use AVAudioSession instead.

!missing-protocol-member! AVAudioPlayerDelegate::audioPlayerEndInterruption:withOptions: not found
## deprecated in iOS8

## All GKSessionError values were deprecated in iOS7 and we never bound then (no point in adding it now)
!missing-field! GKSessionErrorDomain not bound

## enum size declared after the enum, e.g. `typedef NSInteger GKPhotoSize;`, so we miss the metadata

## part of category GKScore_Deprecated
!missing-selector! GKScore::playerID not bound


# Intents

## not exposed by our API (better use the OS version)

# CloudKit

## default init does not work, there's no init in base types, so it's a defacto designated initializer
!extra-designated-initializer! CKMarkNotificationsReadOperation::initWithNotificationIDsToMarkRead: is incorrectly decorated with an [DesignatedInitializer] attribute
## we offer a better managed API using another selector
!missing-selector! CKRecord::objectForKeyedSubscript: not bound
!missing-selector! CKRecord::setObject:forKeyedSubscript: not bound
