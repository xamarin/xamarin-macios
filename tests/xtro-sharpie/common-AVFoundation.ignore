## there's a type of the same name (like NSObject, check what Swift did)
!missing-protocol! AVVideoCompositionInstruction not bound

## fixed in XAMCORE_3_0 - API break
!incorrect-protocol-member! AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate::resourceLoader:shouldWaitForLoadingOfRequestedResource: is OPTIONAL and should NOT be abstract
!incorrect-protocol-member! AVAudioMixing::destinationForMixer:bus: is REQUIRED and should be abstract

## Used only once in a deprecated API, native use `NSInteger` not a real enum - that's why there's a `[Native]`
!unknown-native-enum! AVAudioSessionFlags bound

## native use `NSUInteger` not a real enum - that's why there's a `[Native]`
!unknown-native-enum! AVAudioSessionInterruptionFlags bound

## We only bind "finished" as we cannot use [Bind] here as it would break compatibility with iOS 6.x
## `isFinished` was only added in iOS 7.0 SDK and cannot be called in earlier versions
!missing-selector! AVAssetResourceLoadingRequest::isFinished not bound

## it's already defined in the base class, it's fine even if it returns mutable tracks in this case 
!missing-selector! AVMutableComposition::tracks not bound

## type and protocol are named identically (check the swift name, it's a similar situation to NSObject)
!missing-protocol-conformance! AVVideoCompositionInstruction should conform to AVVideoCompositionInstruction

## AVAudioPlayer INTERRUPTION NOTIFICATIONS ARE DEPRECATED - Use AVAudioSession instead.
