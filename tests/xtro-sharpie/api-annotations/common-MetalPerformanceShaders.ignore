## autogenerated, likely due to the addition (xcode9) of `initWithCoder:device:`

## Manually bound and Sealed

# Manually bound variadic selectors

## According to header docs the following are deprecated and not binary compatibile,
## so there is not much point in binding/using these, they only short lived
## for iOS 11.3 and Mac 10.13.4 and were considered experimental.

## The DesignatedInitializer is now deprecated in favor of a new one

# Disabled due to 'MPSImageBatchIterate' is not in the native library rdar://47282304.

# Looks like these two types were removed at some point and we just ignored this mess,
# just moving from the ignored file to here for now

# Looks like the following selectors were released ahead of their time: Xcode 12 / iOS 13 / macOS 15

# `*Count` values can change over time -> breaking change for us

# unused (came along some API yet to be bound)
