## All GKSessionError values were deprecated in iOS7 and we never bound then (no point in adding it now)

## enum size declared after the enum, e.g. `typedef NSInteger GKInviteeResponse;`, so we miss the metadata
!unknown-native-enum! GKInviteeResponse bound

# Xcode 12 beta 3 - these API are missing
# https://github.com/xamarin/maccore/issues/2269

## unsorted
