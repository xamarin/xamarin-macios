## from iOS 4.0 to 5.1
!unknown-field! AVMediaTypeTimedMetadata bound

## Won't be used as a Delegate protocol so no need to mark this one as abstract
!incorrect-protocol-member! AVFragmentMinding::isAssociatedWithFragmentMinder is REQUIRED and should be abstract

## iOS Only. Available on OSX but probably private selector mostly decorated with NS_AVAILABLE_IOS
!missing-field! AVMediaCharacteristicEasyToRead not bound
!missing-field! AVVideoDecompressionPropertiesKey not bound

# Deprecated so won't bind it

## https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/3213 should be fixed before conformance to 'AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering' is restored.
!missing-protocol-conformance! AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer should conform to AVQueuedSampleBufferRendering (defined in 'AVSampleBufferDisplayLayerQueueManagement' category)

## Available on iOS/tvOS/watchOS but headers lack availability so we must ignore in macOS
!unknown-native-enum! AVAudioSessionPromptStyle bound
